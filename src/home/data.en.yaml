        leads: 
            - In the turmoil of World War II, tens of thousands of Estonian 
              people were forced to leave their homeland.
            - In the autumn of 1944, fleeing from the advancing front line and 
              the fear of repression, became massive. Yet, it was hoped that 
              they would return when the situation improved.
            - In 2022, the Estonian Institute of Historical Memory started 
              compiling a database of persons who fled from Estonia during 
              World War II. The patron of the undertaking is the President 
              of the Republic of Estonia, Alar Karis.
        texts:
            - Unfortunately, the absence became decades long, too many never 
              made it back home.
            - Despite the fact that decades have passed since the escape, 
              there is still no clear overview of the number of refugees, 
              their origin, social background and subsequent fate. Previous 
              studies estimate that about 80,000 people fled from Estonia 
              during World War II.
            - "In the first stage of the work, the focus is primarily on the 
              primary target countries to which the refugees went: Sweden and 
              Germany. The data collections in the archives allow us to create 
              a preliminary database of the escaped persons, but we need the 
              great help of people to collect the names of those refugees who 
              remained missing on the way."
            - The first stage of data collection will last until September 2024, 
              when 80 years have passed since the great escape of 1944. As a 
              further goal, we want to follow the journey of refugees in search 
              of a new permanent home. The database creates a basis for future 
              research and records the life of previous generations.
            - The Estonian Institute of Historical Memory is very grateful if 
              fellow countrymen, wherever they live, are willing to support this 
              initiative. Assistance is needed both in terms of information that 
              has not reached the large archives and financial support, which 
              allows us to involve new contributors to process the data.

        texts:
            - During World War II, thousands of people left Estonia for the West, old and young, families were scattered all over the world. In most cases, they were forced to leave their homeland by fear of the Red Army and the new Soviet regime's repressions. We offer you a small selection of video memories from people who were directly affected by these events.
