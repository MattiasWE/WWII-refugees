texts: 
    - In the fateful year of 1944, the attempts of the Otto Tief government to restore the independence of the Republic of Estonia failed. In January 1944, the Soviet Union invaded Estonia, causing fear among the population of the re-establishment of Soviet power that preceded the German occupation (1941-1944). As a result of these events, about 70,000-80,000 people fled Estonia.
