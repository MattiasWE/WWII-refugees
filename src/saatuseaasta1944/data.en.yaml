texts: 
    - In the fateful year of 1944, Otto Tief government’s attempts to restore the independence of the Republic of Estonia failed. In January 1944, the Soviet Union invaded Estonia, causing fear among the population that the Soviet regime, which preceded the German occupation (1941-1944), would be re-established. As a result of these events, approximately 70,000-80,000 people fled Estonia.
    - Below, the reader will find testimonials of the events of 1944, as well as analytical articles by historians.
