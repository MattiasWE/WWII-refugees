    - "The fires of war have come terribly close, but half of Narva's population has stubbornly decided to stay put, despite the orders."
    - "What followed was a most horrid night that decided our fate. Already in the evening, cannons were set up in the vicinity of Narva, and by dusk, a commotion broke out. We were utterly in the midst of war. Bullets fly back and forth across the city. The sky is like a sea of fire. It's a beautiful, yet gruesome sight. The explosions of aerial bombs make our house wobble as if it were made of cardboard! Fires will soon break out. In Narva alone, one can count 7-8 fires. We fear the Russians will march in before morning. We decided to leave the next morning before it’s too late. Even so, grandfather and grandmother wish to stay put."
    - "Thus began our war journey."
